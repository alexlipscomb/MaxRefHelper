# MaxRefHelper
A simple max object to assist in the creation of Max/MSP XML refpages

## MaxRefs
MaxRefs are XML files that document the arguments, messages, inlets, outlets, and attributes that are associated with a Max object. These are particularly useful for type hinting and auto-complete when initializing a new object in Max. However, there's not really documentation on creating the XML files, so I thought I would create a simple HTML form to ease the process a bit. 

Special thanks to Timothy Place and his [refpages tutorial](https://cycling74.com/tutorials/package-authoring-writing-documentation).
